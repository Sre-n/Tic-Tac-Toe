# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper.

The interesting Python project will be build using the pygame library. We will be explaining all the pygame object methods that are used in this project. Pygame is a great library that will allow us to create the window and draw images and shapes on the window. This way we will capture mouse coordinates and identify the block where we need to mark ‘X’ or ‘O’. Then we will check if the user wins the game or not.

Prerequisites
To implement this game, we will use the basic concepts of Python and Pygame which is a Python library for building cross-platform games. It contains the modules needed for computer graphics and sound libraries. To install the library, you can use pip installer from the command line:

Steps to Build a Python Tic Tac Toe Game
1. Initializing game components
2. Initializing Pygame window
3. Load and transform images
4. Define the functions
5. Run the tic tac toe game
